# MACMatch-RDSS
Our method is based on [StyleMatch](https://github.com/KaiyangZhou/ssdg-benchmark) and [FACT](https://github.com/MediaBrain-SJTU/FACT). We thank their extraordinary works. Same as StyleMatch, our code is based on [Dassl.pytorch](https://github.com/KaiyangZhou/Dassl.pytorch) too.

For now we have uploaded the main MACMatch file [macmatch.py](./codes/macmatch.py) and the [logs](./logs/) during training. You can see how the whole model works and the corresponding data during training, but these files alone cannot run directly. If the paper is fortunate enough to be accepted, we will upload the full code promptly after review.

Moreover, we uploaded the trained models and corresponding logs [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tzDcAca227DSZxyeH4w5jIPxCPS8gcHq?usp=drive_link).

# MACMatch-RDSS
Our method is based on [StyleMatch](https://github.com/KaiyangZhou/ssdg-benchmark) and [FACT](https://github.com/MediaBrain-SJTU/FACT). We thank their extraordinary works. Same as StyleMatch, our code is based on [Dassl.pytorch](https://github.com/KaiyangZhou/Dassl.pytorch) too.

The whole project will be re-organized and uploaded soon.

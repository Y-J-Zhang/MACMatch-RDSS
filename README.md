# MACMatch-RDSS
Our method is based on [StyleMatch](https://github.com/KaiyangZhou/ssdg-benchmark) and [FACT](https://github.com/MediaBrain-SJTU/FACT). We thank their extraordinary works. Same as StyleMatch, our code is based on [Dassl.pytorch](https://github.com/KaiyangZhou/Dassl.pytorch) too.

We just simply modify [StyleMatch](https://github.com/KaiyangZhou/ssdg-benchmark). You can follow the instruction of [StyleMatch](https://github.com/KaiyangZhou/ssdg-benchmark) and replace stylematch.py to macmatch.py. We **cannot** guarantee that the code is reliable at the moment, once we have time we will check and re-organize the code and upload it.

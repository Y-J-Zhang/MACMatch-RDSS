# MACMatch-RDSS
Our method is based on [StyleMatch](https://github.com/KaiyangZhou/ssdg-benchmark) and [FACT](https://github.com/MediaBrain-SJTU/FACT). We thank their extraordinary works. Same as StyleMatch, our code is based on [Dassl.pytorch](https://github.com/KaiyangZhou/Dassl.pytorch) too.

For now we have uploaded the main MACMatch file macmatch.py and the logs during training. You can see how the whole model works and the corresponding data during training, but you cannot run the whole model directly with these files alone. If the paper is fortunate enough to be accepted, we will upload the full code promptly after the review.
